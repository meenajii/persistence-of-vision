Propeller led display (pov) persistence of vision
  The aim of this project is to display information like Name, Title, Time and any other information on it. It is a very simple and interesting project for hobbyist. By using some LED’s we can display any information on it. Here we have used 5×7 Dot-Matrix codes for displaying information. This circuit is attached to a DC Electric Motor. This project is based on concept of persistence of vision (POV).  Means if an object is remaining constant, at a point while it is moving at very fast speed then it looks like a stable image or pattern.
